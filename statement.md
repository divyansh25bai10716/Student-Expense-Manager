# Project Statement — Student Expense Manager

## Problem Statement

College students often receive pocket money or allowances from parents, but most fail to manage or track their expenses properly.  
As a result, they face financial shortages before the end of the month and have no record of where the money was spent.

This project solves this problem by providing a simple expense management system.
